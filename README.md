# All Necessary Topics Related to AI Engineering

A citation-backed Next.js reference for the topics an applied AI engineer
needs. It has 14 parts, from LLM fundamentals to AI application
architecture, and a last part with ten visual and interactive learning
resources. Each topic has three voices: Technical (diagrams, code, cited
sources), Layman's (plain English with analogies), and বাংলা (Bangla
explanation).

Live site: https://kawsar-95.github.io/ai-learning-roadmap/

## Stack

- **Next.js 16.4** (App Router, static export)
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript 5**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (CSS-first config in `globals.css`)
- **Zod 4** (content validation at build time)
- **MiniSearch** (search in the browser)

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # validates content, then writes the static site to out/
npm test         # runs the tests in tests/
npm run lint
npx serve out    # previews the static build at http://localhost:3000
```

`npm run start` does not work. The site is a static export, so `next start`
has no server build to serve.

## Hosting

The site runs on GitHub Pages. `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` runs on
every push to `main`, and you can also start it from the Actions tab. It:

1. Installs dependencies and runs the tests.
2. Builds the static site with `PAGES_BASE_PATH` set to
   `/ai-learning-roadmap`.
3. Publishes `out/` to GitHub Pages.

`next.config.ts` reads `PAGES_BASE_PATH` as the `basePath`. Local builds do
not set it, so the site serves from `/`. Code that builds a URL by hand
(not through `next/link` or the router) must add
`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`, as the search palette does.

## Routes

| Route                       | What it is                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                         | Landing page. An index of the 14 parts.            |
| `/topics/<slug>`            | One part, with prev/next links and an outline.     |
| `/roadmap/`                 | The study roadmap: 20 phases, 542 lessons.         |
| `/roadmap/<phase>/<lesson>/` | One lesson of the roadmap (English only).         |
| `/search-index.json`        | The search index. Built at build time.             |
| `/bn/`, `/bn/topics/<slug>`, `/bn/roadmap/` | The same pages in Bangla. See "Languages". |
| `/bn/search-index.json`     | The Bangla search index.                           |

The 14 parts, in order:

| Part | Route                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | `/topics/llm-fundamentals`                 |
| 2    | `/topics/prompt-engineering`               |
| 3    | `/topics/context-engineering`              |
| 4    | `/topics/rag-knowledge-systems`            |
| 5    | `/topics/agents-and-agentic-systems`       |
| 6    | `/topics/tool-use-and-integrations`        |
| 7    | `/topics/inference`                        |
| 8    | `/topics/llmops-and-observability`         |
| 9    | `/topics/evaluation-engineering`           |
| 10   | `/topics/cost-and-performance-optimization` |
| 11   | `/topics/safety-security-and-guardrails`   |
| 12   | `/topics/multimodal-engineering`           |
| 13   | `/topics/ai-application-architecture`      |
| 14   | `/topics/visual-learning-resources`        |

The order is set in one place: `TOPIC_ORDER` in `src/lib/topics.ts`.

Only these 14 slugs exist. Any other URL gets the 404 page.

## Content

Each part is one file: `src/content/<slug>.json`. To edit content, edit that
file. `npm run build` validates every file against the schema. A bad file
fails the build.

The schema is in [`src/lib/content-schema.ts`](src/lib/content-schema.ts).
A file has this shape:

```
{ slug, title, tagline?, lede, bn: { title, tagline?, lede }, sections: [...], sources: [...] }
```

Each section has `id`, `num`, `title`, `sub`, `bn: { title, sub }` (the
Bangla title and intro), three lists of blocks
(`body` for Technical, `layman`, and `bangla`), an optional `videos`
list, an optional `embeds` list, and an optional `practice` list.

An embed is a live page from another site, shown under the section intro:
`{ url, title, note, noteBn, frame?, autoload?, height?, designWidth? }`. The schema
accepts only an `https` URL on a host in `FRAMEABLE_HOSTS` or
`LINK_ONLY_HOSTS` (both in `src/lib/content-schema.ts`). A page loads in a
sandboxed frame when the reader clicks. `autoload: true` loads it when it
nears the screen, so use it only for light pages. A publisher that blocks
framing (it sends `frame-ancestors`, as Substack does) goes in
`LINK_ONLY_HOSTS`, and its embed needs `frame: false`. It then shows as a
link card. `designWidth` is for an app that needs a wide screen: the frame
keeps that width and shrinks to fit a narrower column. Before you add a host, open the page in a frame in a real
browser to check that it loads.

A block has a `type`. These are the block types:

| Type        | Purpose                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `paragraph` | A paragraph of text.                                 |
| `heading`   | A level 3 or level 4 heading with an `id`.           |
| `list`      | An ordered or unordered list.                        |
| `code`      | A code sample. It stores the source and its highlighted HTML. |
| `diagram`   | An inline SVG with optional captions.                |
| `callout`   | A box with a variant: info, good, warn, danger, or pink. |
| `analogy`   | A box for an analogy.                                |
| `pillGrid`  | A grid of label and value pairs.                     |
| `table`     | A table with headers and rows.                       |
| `panels`    | Side-by-side panels, each with a heading and blocks. |
| `divider`   | A horizontal rule.                                   |
| `html`      | Raw HTML. Use it only when no other type fits.       |

Inline text (`html` fields on paragraphs, headings, list items, and so on)
allows only these tags: `strong`, `em`, `code`, `br`, `a` (a citation link
`<a class="cite" href="#srcN">` or an `http(s)` link). The schema rejects
any other tag.

`src/lib/topics.ts` loads and validates the 14 files, and it exposes the
parts in order. Only server code imports it. Client components get data as
props.

Only these components render raw HTML: `Inline.tsx`, `CodeBlock.tsx`,
`Diagram.tsx`, and `RawHtml.tsx`.

## Videos

Each section can list YouTube videos in `videos`:

```json
{ "id": "zduSFxRajkE", "title": "Let's build the GPT Tokenizer", "channel": "Andrej Karpathy", "lang": "en" }
```

- `id` is the 11-character YouTube video ID. `lang` is `en` or `bn`.
- Copy `title` and `channel` from YouTube's oEmbed answer:
  `https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>`.
  A 200 answer also confirms that the video is public and allows embedding.
- Technical and Layman's show the English videos. বাংলা shows the Bangla
  videos first, then the English ones. All three shows all of them.
- A card loads nothing from YouTube until the reader clicks it. Then it
  plays in place through `youtube-nocookie.com`.

The cards are `src/components/content/VideoList.tsx` and `VideoCard.tsx`.
The voice rule is `src/lib/videos.ts`.

## Practice

Each section has a "Practice" panel with guided tasks. A reader does them
in any free AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini). No install, code, or API
key is necessary. In a part with several sections, each section has 1
task. A part with only 1 big section has 4 tasks.

Each task has an English and a Bangla version. The বাংলা voice shows the
Bangla version. The other voices show the English version. The Bangla
version keeps English technical words (prompt, token, model, and so on).

A task is one entry in the section's `practice` list:

```json
{
  "en": {
    "title": "See why the AI gives different answers",
    "why": "A chatbot can give a different answer to the same question.",
    "steps": [
      {
        "chat": "new",
        "do": "Copy this prompt, paste it, and press Enter.",
        "prompt": "Complete this sentence with one word only: Once upon a time, there was a little",
        "expect": "One word, for example <em>girl</em>.",
        "example": "girl"
      },
      { "chat": "new", "do": "Do step 1 two more times, each in a new chat.", "expect": "Often a different word." }
    ],
    "learned": "The AI picks each word partly by chance.",
    "done": "You have 3 story words.",
    "check": { "question": "Why does the word change?", "answer": "..." },
    "challenge": "Ask for the most common word. What changes?"
  },
  "bn": { "...": "the same fields, in Bangla" }
}
```

| Field | Shown as |
|---|---|
| `why` | Why this matters |
| `steps[].chat` | A NEW CHAT or SAME CHAT label. The first step is always `new`. |
| `steps[].do` | What to do in this step |
| `steps[].prompt` | A box with a Copy button, inside the step |
| `steps[].expect` | You should see: |
| `steps[].example` | Example answer, hidden until the reader opens it |
| `learned` | What just happened |
| `done` | You are done when |
| `check` | Check yourself, with a hidden answer |
| `challenge` | Try a harder version |

- `title`, `prompt`, and `example` are plain text. The other text fields
  allow the inline tags.
- A prompt must hold all the material that the task needs.
- The panel shows the chat links and a "How practice works" box one time,
  above the tasks. Do not repeat that text in a task.
- The schema checks that both versions exist and that the first step opens
  a new chat.

The panel is `src/components/content/PracticeList.tsx` and `CopyButton.tsx`.
The voice-to-language rule is `src/lib/practice.ts`.

## Languages

Every page exists in English and in Bangla (বাংলা).

| | English | Bangla |
|---|---|---|
| URL | `/`, `/topics/<slug>/` | `/bn/`, `/bn/topics/<slug>/` |
| Interface text | English | Bangla, from `UI.bn` in `src/lib/i18n.ts` |
| Part and section titles and intros | `title`, `tagline`, `lede`, `sub` | the `bn` fields of the content |
| A section opens in | Technical | বাংলা (listed first in the voice switcher) |
| Practice tasks | English (Bangla in the বাংলা voice) | Bangla in every voice |
| Videos | English (Bangla first in the বাংলা voice) | Bangla first, then English, in every voice |
| Technical and Layman's text, code, diagrams | English | English (one click away) |

- Bangla text keeps English technical words (prompt, token, model, and so
  on) where Bangla has no common word.
- The header button switches to the same page in the other language and
  keeps the section in view. It saves the choice in `localStorage` (key
  `lang`).
- An inline script in `<head>` (`langInitScript` in `src/lib/i18n.ts`)
  sets `<html lang>` from the URL before the first paint. If the reader
  chose the other language before, it opens the same page in that
  language. Without JavaScript, each URL shows its own language.
- The English pages are in the route group `src/app/(en)/` and the Bangla
  pages in `src/app/bn/`. Both render the same page components
  (`src/components/pages/`) with a `lang` prop. `SiteShell` draws the
  header, sidebar, and footer in that language.
- The 404 page shows its text in both languages.
- To add an interface string, add it to `en` in `src/lib/i18n.ts`. The
  type then requires it in `bn` too.

## Search

Press Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on macOS) to open the search palette.

1. At build time, `src/app/search-index.json/route.ts` makes one search
   document for each section. The text comes from the Technical voice.
2. On the first open, the palette fetches `search-index.json` under the
   base path.
3. The palette builds a MiniSearch index in the browser and searches as you
   type.
4. A result links to the section, for example `/topics/inference#<id>`.

The Bangla site uses `/bn/search-index.json`. Its documents hold the
Bangla titles, the বাংলা voice, and the Technical text, so English terms
such as "token" find results too. Results link to `/bn/` pages.

The shared helpers are in `src/lib/search.ts`.

## Source quality

All citations resolve to:

- **arXiv papers** for the foundational techniques (BPE, SentencePiece, CoT,
  ReAct, Reflexion, MemGPT, LLMLingua, Lost-in-the-Middle, and others).
- **Vendor documentation** for production patterns (Anthropic prompt
  caching, OpenAI prompt caching, Gemini caching, OpenAI Structured Outputs,
  Anthropic tool use).

## Design notes

- The site has a light and a dark theme. Design tokens are CSS variables in
  `globals.css`, one set for each theme. Each extra voice has its own color:
  Layman's is violet, বাংলা is green. Every text color has 4.5:1 contrast
  or more on the page and card backgrounds.
- The sun/moon button in the header switches the theme. On the first visit
  the site follows the device setting. After a click, `localStorage`
  (key `theme`) keeps the choice. An inline script in `<head>`
  (`THEME_INIT_SCRIPT` in `src/lib/theme.ts`) sets `data-theme` on `<html>`
  before the first paint, so the page does not flash. Without JavaScript
  the site shows the dark theme.
- Code blocks stay dark in both themes. Their Shiki colors are inline in
  the content HTML.
- Diagram SVGs use fixed colors made for a dark ground. In the light
  theme, `globals.css` maps each solid diagram color to a darker or lighter
  one. If you add a diagram with a new solid color, add it to that map.
- Fraunces (headings), Inter, JetBrains Mono, and Noto Sans Bengali load
  through `next/font/google` with `display: swap`.
- The sidebar lists the 14 parts. Below the `lg` breakpoint, a menu button
  opens the same list.
- The voice switcher works for one section at a time. Its options are
  Technical, Layman's, বাংলা, and All three. A section shows only the
  voices that have content.
- Topic pages show an outline (TOC) on wide screens. It uses
  `IntersectionObserver` to mark the section in view. Heading links in the
  outline work in every voice.
- Content is static. `next build` writes every route to `out/` as HTML.

## Roadmap

`/roadmap/` (and `/bn/roadmap/`) is a study path through the open
[AI Engineering from Scratch](https://github.com/rohitg00/ai-engineering-from-scratch)
curriculum. It groups the 20 phases into 7 stages, marks five phases as
optional depth, links each phase to the Parts of this site that cover the same
ground, and lets you tick lessons off. Progress is saved in the browser under
its own `roadmap-progress` key, separate from the Part progress.

Each lesson is a page of this site, at `/roadmap/<phase folder>/<lesson folder>/`
(for example `/roadmap/11-llm-engineering/01-prompt-engineering/`). The text is
the curriculum's `docs/en.md`, rendered at build time with `react-markdown`
(raw HTML in it is sanitized). The lesson text is English only, so there are no
`/bn/` lesson pages; the Bangla roadmap links to the English lessons, and the
language switch on a lesson goes to the Bangla roadmap. Links between lessons
become links between these pages. Links to the lessons' code and outputs go to
GitHub. Mermaid diagrams show their source, because the site loads no diagram
library. Lesson pages are left out of the offline cache: they add about 200 MB to
`out/`.

- `src/data/roadmap-lessons.json` is generated from the curriculum's
  `ROADMAP.md`. Refresh it with
  `node scripts/build-roadmap.mjs <path to the curriculum repo>`.
- `src/data/lessons/` (the lesson text) and `public/lesson-assets/` (their
  images) are copied from the curriculum with
  `node scripts/build-lessons.mjs <path to the curriculum repo>`. Run it after
  `build-roadmap.mjs`, and commit the results. The curriculum is MIT licensed;
  its notice is in `src/data/lessons/LICENSE`.
- `src/data/roadmap-phases.json` is written by hand: the stages, a one-line
  summary of each phase (English and Bangla), which phases are optional, and
  the related Parts.
- `npm run build` and `npm test` check that the two files agree: every phase
  has a summary and a stage, lesson numbers do not repeat, and every related
  Part exists. They also check that every lesson has its text, every image is
  copied, and every link between lessons resolves.

## AI tutor

`src/tutor/` is a tutor that answers questions about the curriculum. It is
framework-free: `createTutorHandler` takes a `Request` and returns a streaming
`Response` (Server-Sent Events), so it runs in Node, a Next route handler,
Hono or a worker.

- The system prompt holds the whole outline (20 phases, 542 lesson folders and
  titles), cached, followed by a short summary of the learner's progress.
  The tutor knows titles and phase summaries, not lesson text.
- The request is `{ "messages": [...], "done": ["0/1", ...] }`, where `done`
  holds the lesson keys the roadmap page stores. It is validated with zod.
- The model call (`src/tutor/anthropic.ts`) uses the Anthropic SDK with
  `claude-opus-5-5` (override with `TUTOR_MODEL`), medium effort, and the
  server-side fallback, so a declined request is retried on another model.

The static site cannot host the endpoint, so run it separately:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... TUTOR_ALLOW_ORIGIN=https://kawsar-95.github.io \
  node scripts/tutor-server.ts          # POST http://localhost:8787/tutor
```

Then build the site with `NEXT_PUBLIC_TUTOR_URL=<the endpoint URL>`. On GitHub
Pages, set it as a repository variable named `TUTOR_URL` (Settings, Secrets and
variables, Actions, Variables); `deploy-pages.yml` passes it to the build. The "Ask
the tutor" box on `/roadmap/` appears only when that variable is set.
`scripts/tutor-server.ts` limits each client address to `TUTOR_PER_MINUTE`
(default 20) requests a minute. It reads the address from `X-Forwarded-For`,
so run it behind a proxy that sets that header, or replace `allow`.
To use the tutor in another app, import `createTutorHandler` and
`createAnthropicModel` from `src/tutor/index.ts` and pass the stages from
`buildRoadmap` (`src/lib/roadmap-schema.ts`).
